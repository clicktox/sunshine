				<h3>ModernMom Insiders Say:</h3>

				<div class="reviews">
					<p><b>*ModernMom Insiders received products to test from Cloraseptic but their opinions are their own.</b></p>
				
				<p><b>Jorge</b><br>My son woke me up in the night with a bad cough - I gave him the spray and he went back to sleep. I gave him the cough drops and put it next to his bed and when he woke up he took one and it did the job! So happy - Chloraseptic is the best!! </p>
								
				<p><b>Malory</b><br>Unfortunately the flu hit early this year for my family. My daughter loved the citrus lozenges, my husband and I are fans of the spray. It's tough being sick for anyone, but for us moms, you can't just lay and get well, you have to take care of everyone else and let me tell you. Chloraseptic really helped take the pain in my throat away so I could function!</p>
				
				<p><b>Carmen </b><br>My household had a chance to try your medicine, unfortunately, we were all sick. I have to say that the liquid was pretty good, taste and worked up fast. The lozenges were not as good, the taste is not as expected, and it leaves you a heartburn.</p>
				
				<p><b>Kelly W</b><br>I had never used a spray before for sore throats and wow - it really worked. It took the pain away - I can't believe I didn't buy this sooner! Once I used the spray, I didn't need the lozenge.</p>
				
				<p><b>Gigi</b><br>I'm always a bit weary of cough drops because of the medicine taste but I actually really liked the citrus. They really worked and I recommended them to my child's teacher who has been sick all week!</p>
				
				<p><b>Margaret </b><br>Chloraseptic spray means that when I get a sore throat, my whole day doesn't have to stop. I can throw it in my bag and it gives me relief while I go on with my life.</p>
				<p><b>Caron D</b><br>Oh thank you for sending the goodies. Last week I was experiencing post nasal drip and my throat was sore. I looked in the medicine cabinet for relief. I popped one of the lozenges in and it started to work immediately. I really didn't care for the medicine-taste, but my throat liked it. I was glad to have received the goodies. I wasn't about to go out to the store at 10pm. Thanks!</p>
				<p><b>Liza L</b><br>Sore throats are so annoying - it's hard to eat, talk, anything. But with Chloraseptic spray I got pain relief FAST.</p>
				<p><b>NY Crys</b><br>My daughter and I both came down with a nasty sore throat/cold right after I received the package of chloraseptic products to try from modernmom!! The spray was great for instant relief (my daughter seemed to prefer the spray) but I really liked the lozenges as they were very soothing . Thank you soo much for giving us the opportunity to try these and I will definately buy them in the future.</p>
				
				<p><b>Cathy R</b><br>I ended coming down with a very bad sore throat and a slight cough, so needless to say, I had lots of Chloraseptic goodies to try out! I really love the Chloraseptic Sore Throat Lozenges in Cherry (my favorite) and think the liquid center is very soothing on my throat. The other lozenges were really good too, I just favor the Cherry flavor when I’m not feeling good (I think that’s from when I was a child and we always got Cherry flavored remedies)! The Chloraseptic Sore Throat spray also helped relieve my sore throat and it was nice to be able to spray a little squirt for fast relief. The Chloraseptic Max Sore Throat plus Coating Protection was nice as it has a sprayer on it that sprays the back of the throat and hits the spot every time. Overall, I think the Chloraseptic Throat Pain + Cough remedies worked great and I’m glad I will have them for the next cold…or two to come!</p>
				<p><b>Jenny B</b><br>Strangely enough, I received this package on a day I stayed home sick from work...with congestion, sore throat, and cough!  The maximum strength sugar-free were my favorite.  I liked that they made my throat feel better AND calmed my cough.  I have already highly recommended these to everyone, and really appreciate the package! </p>
				

<p><b>Tracey Q</b><br>So, I woke up in the middle of the night with one of those coughs where your throat is scratchy and you keep coughing but nothing happens. It just continues to be scratchy. So uncomfortable and I couldn't sleep. I then remembered the goodies ModernMom sent. I tried the citrus lozenges and wow - it totally stopped my coughing. What a relief. I will definitely be using these again!! Thank you!</p>
<p><b>Lisa M</b><br>I loved the sugar-free lozenges for my kids who both came down with a sore throat. They loved the squishy center and I loved that their throats felt better!!</p>
<p><b>Anita K.</b><br>After working outside in the cold all day, I came in with a very sore throat that was made worst when I coughed or talked, It even hurt to swallow. With a quick spray of the Chloraseptic Spray and the lozenges I was able to enjoy the rest of my day pain free.   </p>
<p><b>Karen S</b><br>My household had a chance to try your medicine, unfortunately,we were all sick. I have to say that the liquid was pretty good,taste and worked up fast. It's tough being sick for anyone,but for us moms,you can't just lay and get well, you have to take care of everyone else and let me tell you,Chloraseptic really helped take the pain in all of our throats way, so we could function!!! So thank you Chloraseptic for all of your products, don't ever change them!!! Thanks again...</p>
<p><b>Leigh L.</b><br>OMG - thank you so much for this! We all came down with a horrible cough and sore throat and these products saved us. We actually slept because we used the spray.</p>
<p><b>Manuela</b><br>We love the options of the lozenges - they have been great for my whole sick family. My daughter hates the cherry but loves the citrus. My son loves the cherry. Kids prefer lozenges to spray, but my husband and I prefer the spray. These are really going to help us get through the cold and flu season. </p>
<p><b>Mary M</b><br>I didn't really know if these were for coughs or sore throats but let me tell you, they helped me with both. I was losing my voice and that's not good when you are a mom of 4 boys LOL. </p>
<p><b>Stephanie S</b><br>I haven't had this stuff since I was a kid, I found it tasteful and the sore throat I had that day went away really quickly.</p>
<p><b>Jenna</b><br>The spray tastes a little mediciny but it worked so well it was totally worth it! What a relief, I will never go without having this in my medicine cabinet. This stuff really works!</p>
<p><b>Catherine</b><br>I had a tickle in my throat that I just couldn't kick, so I tried some of the Chloraseptic lozenges. Relief was almost instant and my uncomfortable scratchy throat was gone! </p>
<p><b>Stacy</b><br>Just because I have a cold, doesn't mean I can take a sick day off from being a mom. That's why I love Chloraseptic spray, let's me take care of my family even when I don't feel good.</p>
<p><b>Sara C.</b><br>The throat spray actually tastes good, instead of being too "mediciney" and works for such a long time! I had a terrible sore throat, it hurt to swallow and it was so distracting. The spray totally eased the pain and made me feel so much better.</p>
<p><b>Liz H.</b><br>I get sore throats a lot because of seasonal allergies, but a lot of allergy medicine makes me drowsy. The lozenges were a great way to soothe my sore throat without having to load up on pills. </p>
<p><b>Sarah S</b><br>Thank you for the Chloraseptic samples. I enjoyed the berry flavor and thought that the lozenges did a great job of clearing the nasal passages, but it didn't coat my throat as well as I'd hoped, given the advertisement on the box. Overall, I would buy them again, but only as cough drops, not necessarily as an aid to soothe my throat.</p>

<p><b>Leslie A</b><br>Hate being sick, hate having that dry itchy cough that is so irritating and will not go away no matter how much you cough. These cough drops seriously help this! What a relief. I can't imagine not using them now that we've used them!! </p>
